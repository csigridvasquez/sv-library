# Homebrews: Rules & Mechanics

## ⚙️Rule
**What it is:** A directive that says _what you can or can’t do_ in the game.
**Purpose:** Keeps structure and fairness at the table.
	- You need to roll a d20 to attack.”
	- “A short rest takes 1 hour.”
	- “Drinking a potion takes an action.”

**Rules are the “laws” of the game — the yes/no, do/don’t parts.**
## ⚙️ Mechanic
**What it is:** A system or procedure that explains _how something works_ in the game.
**Purpose:** Gives a consistent way to resolve actions and challenges.
	- Advantage/disadvantage.
	- Death saving throws.**
	- Inspiration points.
	- Hit points and healing.

**Mechanics are the “engines” of the game — they make the rules run.**

>[!tip] Tl;dr
>**Rules** = the **instructions**
>**Mechanics** = the systems you use to **follow those instructions**. 

 I've included a mix of stuff that are essentially buffs and nerfs (or both!) compared to 5e rules and mechanics - let me know what you think!

# Rolling
## Crits
When you roll a 20 on a d20 attack roll, saving throw, or ability check (before applying any modifiers, bonuses, and penalties), this is referred to as a “natural 20”. Rolling a 1 on a d20 attack roll, saving throw, or ability check (before applying any modifiers, bonuses, and penalties) is referred to as a “natural 1”.

>[!important]
> **Critical Hits and Fumbles.** A natural 20 on an attack roll is a critical hit and is always successful. On the flip side, rolling a natural 1 on an attack roll is considered a critical fumble and always misses. 
>
>**Critical Saves**. A natural 20 on a saving throw is a critical save and always succeeds. A natural 1 on a saving throw is always a failure.
>
>**Critical Successes**. A natural 20 on an ability check or skill check  is a critical success so long as the creature attempting it would normally have succeeded on the check. For example, a baby goblin could never break out of steel manacles using Strength but an adult warrior goblin might. On a critical success the objective of the check is achieved and something else happens as well.
> 
>**Critical Failures.** A natural 1 on an ability check is a critical failure so long as the creature attempting it would normally have failed on the check. On a critical failure, the objective of the check is failed, and something unfortunate happens as well.
>
>**Group Criticals.** When making a group check, a critical success is achieved if all members of the party succeed in their checks, while a critical failure takes place if all members of the party fail.

## Exploding Damage Dice
When you roll damage for an attack, spell, or ability, and any of the damage dice shows its maximum value (such as a 6 on a d6 or an 8 on a d8), that die explodes. Roll that die one additional time and add the result to the total damage*.*

<br>

---
## Rolling with Emphasis
**Roll 2d20. Take the result that’s furthest from 10 (the most extreme)**
This mechanic makes extreme results more likely and “middle of the road” results less likely. It’s a way to make the big, tense moments feel even bigger — when the stakes are high, when the drama’s loud, and when the story calls for something bold. Best used as an alternative to a straight luck check (d20 DC11).

<br>

---
## Miraculous Strike
If you roll with disadvantage and get at least one Nat 20, everyone around you is inspired by your determination/effort/luck and gets advantage on their next roll.

<br>

---
## GM Inspiration
The DM may award GM Inspiration for good roleplay, clever ideas, or just straight up cool fucking moments that add to the story.
When you have Inspiration, which is a d20 die, you can spend it to gain advantage on an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw. You can decide to use it after you roll but before the result is revealed.

<br>

---
## Giving Help action
A Help action can be taken by a character (as an action during combat or any time out of combat) to aid another character in the ability check, attack or saving throw they are trying to do. Mechanically, this means that the helped character can roll this ability with advantage. Either PC will be required to describe and explain how they are helping or how they are being helped. Whether the description or explanation suffices is upon DM's discretion.

<br>

---
## Spamming Ability Checks
A PC may only attempt an ability check once per circumstance. Once you’ve made the roll, accept the outcome—success or failure—and let the story move forward. Let the rolls be meaningful.
	If the rest of your party are in the same scenario as you, they can attempt the same check once as well.

<br>

---
## Off-Ability Check.
The GM may call for, or a player may propose, an alternative ability–skill combination when it better represents the action being attempted. The goal is to let the description of your action drive the mechanics—not the other way around. **Decide ability first, skill second.**

>[!example]- **For example: PC wants to intimidate via their athletic prowess.**
> Roll STR (Intimidation), not Athletics (since Athletics is about climbing, grappling, etc.)	
>> [!todo]- Resolution: Roll: d20 + ability modifier + proficiency bonus
>>Ability Modifier: based on the ability you’re swapping in
>>Proficiency bonus added only if proficient in the skill

<br>

---
## Critical Mastery.
When you roll a natural 20 on an skill check, you gain **Critical Mastery** for that skill.
You may spend your **Critical Mastery** to gain advantage on a future check of the same skill.

You can only hold one **Critical Mastery** per skill, but you may have multiple Critical Masteries across different skills.

<br>

---
## Incompetence
**Incompetence** represents a skill in which your character is notably poor—clumsy, forgetful, or just plain bad at it. 
Whenever you gain a skill proficiency as part of your Background, select a different skill in which you will have **Incompetence**. If you do not take skill proficiencies, you do not take an **Incompetence**.
	5e 2014 backgrounds (PHB) all feature 2 skill proficiencies. For 5e 2024, take 2 skills for Incompetence regardless of how your Origin is crafted.

If you are **Incompetent** in a skill, you roll checks with disadvantage when using that skill. You also cannot give the **Help** action to another character making a skill check with the skill you are Incompetent in.****

>[!important]
> Incompetence overrides proficiency — you cannot later gain proficiency or expertise in that skill unless the DM rules a narrative reason for growth or training removes the incompetence.

<br>

---
# Rest
## Short Rest
Requires at least **one hour** out of combat or adventuring activity. At the end of a short rest, you can spend one or more hit dice to recover lost hit points up to your maximum. For each hit die spent, roll the appropriate dice and add them together. You can spend them one at a time.

Additionally, recover expended spell slots equal to or less than half your spellcasting level rounded up. See [[#Short rest recovery]].

>[!warning]- Long rest removed
>Any rest taken, regardless of length, is considered a short rest unless it satisfies all the requirements of a safe rest. Also applies interrupted safe rests.`

<br>

---
## Safe Rest
Replaces "long rest". Requires at least **8 hours** out of combat or adventuring activity in a safe place (designated by the DM), typically lodging at a tavern, and at least 6 of those hours must be spent sleeping. On completion:
- regain up to half of your total hit dice
- recover up to your maximum HP
- remove 1 level of exhaustion

<br>

---
## Downtime
Often in periods during adventures where nothing “important” is happening, your character will have “downtime” in which to do perform more mundane activities.
Some activities laid out from [[Xanathar's Guide to Everything\|Xanathar's Guide to Everything]], although availability of these activities depend on the campaign.

>[!check] Downtime mechanics
>- Roll a d20 to determine success of the downtime activity, adding appropriate modifiers.
>- They can only attempt 1 check per set period-of-time (usually 1 week). The DC for downtime success is 15 (increased to 20 for PCs at least Level 5, 25 for PCs at least level 10).
>- DC is lowered by 5 on the next attempt of the same activity following a failure. DC can be lowered twice up to DC 10.

>[!example]- Examples of downtime activities:
>>[!check]- **Buying a Magic Item**
>>Purchasing a magic item requires time and money to seek out and contact people willing to sell items. Even then, there is no guarantee a seller will have the items a character desires.
>
>>[!check]- **Crafting an Item**
>>A character who has the time, the money, and the needed tools can use downtime to craft armor, weapons, clothing, or other kinds of nonmagical gear.
>
>>[!check]- **Gambling**
>>Games of chance are a way to make a fortune — and perhaps a better way to lose one.
>
>>[!check]- **Pit Fighting**
>>Pit fighting includes boxing, wrestling, and other nonlethal forms of combat in an organized setting with predetermined matches. If you want to introduce competitive fighting in a battle-to-the-death situation, the standard combat rules apply to that sort of activity.
>
>>[!check]- **Relaxation**
>>Sometimes the best thing to do between adventures is relax. Whether a character wants a hard-earned vacation or needs to recover from injuries, relaxation is the ideal option for adventurers who need a break.
>
>>[!check]- **Religious Service**
>>Characters with a religious bent might want to spend downtime in service to a temple, either by attending rites or by proselytizing in the community. Someone who undertakes this activity has a chance of winning the favor of the temple’s leaders.
>
>>[!check]- **Research**
>>Forewarned is forearmed. The research downtime activity allows a character to delve into lore concerning a monster, a location, a magic item, or some other particular topic.
>
>>[!check]- **Scribe a Spell Scroll**
>>With time and patience, a spellcaster can transfer a spell to a scroll, creating a spell scroll.
>
>>[!check]- **Training**
>>Given enough free time and the services of an instructor, a character can learn a language or pick up proficiency with a tool.
>
>>[!check]- **Work**
>>When all else fails, an adventurer can turn to an honest trade to earn a living. This activity represents a character’s attempt to find temporary work, the quality and wages of which are difficult to predict.

# Combat/Action Economy

## Ammunition and Spellcasting Components
We're going a tiny bit easier on spellcasting and ammunition. Spells in this campaign **require only verbal and somatic component**s; material components are ignored, unless a spell’s description or this document specifically states otherwise (see [[#^Spellcasting]]).  Likewise, ammunition are not tracked for weapons with the ammunition mechanic.

## Attack Crits
When you roll a natural 20 on an attack roll, your attack hits with extra force. Roll the attack's regular damage and add maximum damage dice.

#### Splash Damage.
After applying your critical hit damage, choose another enemy within 5 feet of your original target. That creature takes damage equal to half of the total rolled damage (rounded down).

<br>

---
## Weapon Mastery
You can only use [[Weapons#Mastery Properties\|Weapon Mastery]] properties a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.
#Barbarian #Fighter #Paladin #Ranger #Rogue 

<br>

---
## Revised Potions
A small buff to potions:

| Type of Potion             | Dice    |
| -------------------------- | ------- |
| Potion of Lesser Healing   | 3d6     |
| Potion of Greater Healing  | 5d6     |
| Potion of Superior Healing | 8d6 + 2 |

>[!tip] Potions as a Bonus Action
Instead of an action, drinking a healing potion can be a bonus action.

<br>

---
## 1-Action Cantrips as Bonus Actions/Reactions
1-action cantrips that are often treated as “quick buffs” or “fast reactions” in play (and that some DMs let you bend into bonus action/reaction territory, depending on flavor or homebrew flexibility).

| Cantrip          | What It Does                                                                  | Additional Tweaks                                                                                                   |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Druidcraft       | Predict weather, make flowers bloom, tiny harmless effects.                   |                                                                                                                     |
| Guidance         | Target gets +1d4 to an ability check (before roll).                           | Allowed as a reaction if the caster hasn’t used their reaction yet, but only for ally rolls (not their own).        |
| Light            | Create a small light                                                          |                                                                                                                     |
| Mage Hand        | Conjure a magical hand                                                        | Allow “simple gestures” (like opening a door or grabbing an object) as a bonus action once the hand is already out. |
| Message          | Whisper a message to a creature within range                                  |                                                                                                                     |
| Minor Illusion   | Creates a sound or image.                                                     | Could be a bonus action if kept very simple (like a noise), but larger illusions stay 1 action.                     |
| Prestidigitation | Minor magical tricks (flavor)                                                 | Allowed as a bonus action since they’re mostly cosmetic, speeding up RP without breaking combat balance.            |
| Resistance       | Target gets +1d4 to a saving throw.                                           |                                                                                                                     |
| Thaumaturgy      | Voice, tremors, eye-flare, doors slam.                                        |                                                                                                                     |
| True Strike      | Gain advantage on your first attack roll against the target on your next turn |                                                                                                                     |

# Spellcasting

## Short rest recovery
Recover expended spell slots equal to or less than half your spellcasting level rounded up after a short rest.

 >[!tip] in PHB, Arcane Recovery is available to wizards only and only once per long rest. This mechanic changes that.`

<br>

---
## Revivify
You touch a creature that has died within the last minute. That creature returns to life with 1 hit point and 1 level of exhaustion. This spell can't return to life a creature that has died of old age, nor can it restore any missing body parts.

This spell requires material equal to 300 G on the caster's person to complete.

`Note: added exhaustion mechanic and reaffirmed material requirement.`
