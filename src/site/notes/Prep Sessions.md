# Campaign Prep
## Get to know
- Tell me about you!
- Tell us about your D&D experience - how long in years, how many year long games, short campaigns, one-shots; what types of D&D media do you consume? etc
- What did you like and not like about those games?

## Commitment
**How long of a story are we committing to?**
- [ ] **One shot quest** - A single, self-contained adventure.
- [ ] **Short quest** (3-4 sessions) - A brief story with a clear start and finish.
- [ ] **Mini campaign** (4-6 sessions) - A small campaign allowing for character growth and a few subplots.
- [ ] **Standard Campaign** (8-12 sessions) - A full narrative arc with room for multiple storylines.
- [ ] **Epic Campaign** (12+ sessions) — A long-term story with major shifts in power, wars, betrayals, and personal transformations.

>[!question] Are we ok with going maybe 1-2 sessions short or over as needed?

**How often do we meet?**
- [ ] every week
- [ ] every two weeks
- [ ] super tentative; will coordinate and update

**How many hours per session are we willing to commit?**
- Are we ok with going maybe 1-2 hours over as needed?
- Note that this includes time allowance to get everyone set up and settled, as well as a short debrief/cooldown period after each session.

### Level of commitment - personal and as a party
- [ ] **Casual Player** – I’ll join when I can. I don’t need to follow every plot thread to enjoy the game.
- [ ] **Consistent Player** – I want to stay involved in the main story and finish quest arcs, but it’s okay if I miss a session once in a while.
- [ ] **Core Player** – I plan to be present for every session and keep up with ongoing story and character developments.

>[!warning] I need to have at least half of the party to be Core players, allowing max 10% of the party to be casuals.

### Character Death/Secondary Characters
 - **Create a New Character** – Bring in a new PC introduced naturally in the story.
 
 - **Temporary Character** – Play an NPC or short-term character until a new one fits the plot.
 
 - **Return Option** – The group may pursue a way to revive or restore the fallen character if the story allows.
 
 - **Legacy Character** – Introduce a new PC connected to the old one (family, ally, apprentice, etc.).
 
 - **Group Reset** (for one-shots or short arcs) – If the death changes the party dynamic too much, we may start a new arc with a fresh group.

## Setting Mutual Expectations
- Homebrews on 5e rules.
- Be responsible (character sheet, dice rolls)
- What happens if someone can’t make the session? (Reschedule, skip, run a side scene, etc.
- What are our expectations for showing up on time and communicating absences?
