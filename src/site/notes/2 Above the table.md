# The Big Picture - A Living World

The world you’re stepping into isn’t an empty map — it’s got weather, weird creatures, old ruins, busy towns, and people with their own plans. It doesn’t revolve around the party, but it _does_ react to you. Your **choices**, **priorities**, and **vibe** all help shape what this world becomes.

Your group might end up feeling like:
- **The Heroes.** The spotlight’s on you. Your actions matter on a big scale, and people will remember your names.
- **The Unseen Hands.** You work in the background — sneaky operators, problem-solvers, quiet influencers. The world changes because of you, even if most folks don’t notice.
- **The Witnesses.** You’re here to explore and experience the world. You might not be saving kingdoms, but you’re living in the world, learning from it, and trying to survive it.

None of these are “*better*” than the others. Your group’s natural style will decide where the story leans, and the world will adjust to match the kind of game we all create together.

# Roleplaying

This campaign leans hard into character moments. Combat is cool, but the real magic happens when your character **_feels_** like a person — someone with fears, dreams, weird habits, soft spots, and hot-headed impulses. The story grows out of how you react, connect, argue, joke around, and make choices in the moment.

You don’t need accents, dramatic monologues, or acting chops. What matters is letting your character be real enough that you can care about what happens to them. These games are fun on their own — but when you let yourself sink into the highs, lows, and messy in-betweens of your character, the whole experience hits way **deeper**.

Because of that, I strongly encourage (honestly, almost *insist*) that you play in a way where we can **_see and hear_** you. At the very least, keep your mic hot so we can catch your gasps, your “oh no’s,” your snorts, your laughs — all those little reactions.

Why? Because those small, genuine moments help everyone feel connected. They build trust, spark better roleplay, and give the whole table the emotional feedback that makes scenes land harder. When we can feel your presence, your character’s presence shines through too.

# Story-Forward, Player-Lead

There’s no fixed path here and definitely no “correct” way to play. You and your party decide what matters — whether that’s wandering the wilds, solving odd mysteries, getting tangled in politics, or trying to build something meaningful out in the frontier. The campaign moves in the direction _you_ push it.

Your choices set the tone of the whole story. If you chase danger, it becomes a high-stakes tale. If you focus on survival, it becomes gritty. If you lean into character drama, then the world becomes the stage for it.

My job is to build a world that responds to whatever you choose, and to give you tools, challenges, and consequences that make your decisions feel important. The mechanics are there to support the narrative flow, not limit it. The story grows because of what you do, not because of something pre-written.

***This is your adventure, you decide where it goes.***

## Homebrews
My campaigns use a handful of custom mechanics (Damage Explosion, Rolling with Emphasis, Critical Mastery, and more — see [[3 Homebrew Mechanics\|3 Homebrew Mechanics]]). They aren’t here to make things complicated or crunchy for no reason. They’re here to add flavor, excitement, and reinforce the overall vibe of the game.

Think of them as little boosts that make moments hit harder or feel cooler.

And don’t worry — if anything ever feels confusing, clunky, or just not fun at the table, we can tweak it on the fly. The goal is always a smooth, enjoyable game, not forcing rules that get in the way of the experience. This is all about keeping the game fun, fast, and full of flair.
