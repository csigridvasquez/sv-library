# Lay of the Land

## A Living World
The world is alive, not empty. It has storms, beasts, ruins, and factions with their own goals. It doesn’t bend to your will, but it will react to your presence. This campaign isn’t just about what happens — it’s about how your characters exist within the story.  Your group’s choices, tone, and priorities will shape that balance. 

You might be:
	**The Heroes.** The story revolves around you. Your names will be remembered, and your choices will shape the fate of nations.
	**The Unseen Hands.** You move behind the curtain — spies, manipulators, quiet fixers. The world changes because of you, but few will ever know it.
	**The Witnesses.** You aren’t here to save the world, but to _see_ it — to survive it, understand it, or simply live within it. The world moves on, and you discover what it means to exist inside it.

There’s no “better” role here. Each one is valid, and the story will adapt to the level of scale and impact your party naturally creates.





# Systems of Survival

## Roleplaying
This is a campaign where characters matter as much as combat. What your character fears, what they dream of, and how they connect to others will drive the story forward. Expect chances to bond, bicker, and show off your quirks. Roleplay here isn’t about doing voices or acting “perfect” — it’s simply about letting your character feel real in the world.

## Story-Forward, Player-Lead
There’s no fixed path or “right” answer. You decide what matters most: exploring the lands, chasing mysteries, or trying to rebuild something new. The campaign follows your lead, so your decisions set the tone and direction of the story. Mechanics support the narrative, not the other way around.

## Homebrews
This campaign uses custom mechanics (Damage Explosion, Rolling with Emphasis, Critical Mastery, etc. See [[Homebrew Mechanics\|Homebrew Mechanics]]). These aren’t here to overcomplicate; they’re here to give flavor and reinforce the vibe. If something ever feels clunky or not fun, we’ll tweak it together so the game stays smooth.

# Showing Up
`This section isn’t about rules — it’s about how we make the game enjoyable for everyone. Showing up means being present, listening, reacting, and caring about what’s happening at the table. The more heart you bring, the more the world and this game will give back.` 

## Presence and Participation
Games like these give back what you put into them. A good session, a good story, and those unforgettable moments only happen when everyone brings a little heart to the table. The DM has poured love and time into building this world — all we ask is that you meet it with some of your own.

## Cameras On (If You Can)  
It’s simply easier to connect when we can see one another — to read expressions, share laughs, and feel like we’re in the same room even online. It’s not about performance, it’s about presence. You don’t need perfect lighting or a fancy setup — just show up as yourself.

## Stay Voice-Ready  
Keep your mic on or ready to unmute quickly when it’s your turn, or when you’re in a scene. Small reactions — a laugh, a gasp, a “wait, what?” — are part of what makes this feel alive. Silence kills pacing, and your voice helps the table feel real.

## Be Fully Here  
Avoid multitasking. If you’re not fully available, it’s perfectly okay to reschedule. I’d much rather have everyone present and engaged later than half here and distracted now. We’re here to tell a story together — and that only works if we’re all actually _together_.





# While In-Game
`This is about keeping the story flowing and making sure everyone gets their moments. When we’re in the game, we’re co-authors of something we’ll only ever experience once. A little structure helps keep that magic alive.'

## Campaign Info
While this campaign is mostly **homebrewed**, we might use pre-made campaigns (retextured, of course) depending on factors, so please let me know if there are specific pre-mades you would like for us to avoid.

## Rulings, Not Rules.
We’re using D&D 5e (2014/2024) as our foundation, but our real goal is fun and flow, not legal debates. If something’s unclear, I’ll make a quick ruling to keep the story moving. We can always revisit it after the session.

## Declare Intent — No Secret Rolls.
Say what you’re doing before you roll. I’ll tell you what kind of roll it calls for, if any, and the DC if applicable. If you roll before checking in, it’s void — no take-backs, no “but I already rolled.”

## We Trust You 100%.
We can’t see your dice, so honesty is key. Rolling high feels so much better when you know it’s real. We trust that you’ll call your rolls as they happen — truthfully and in good faith.

## Responsible for Self.
Track your own notes, inventory, and stats. The game’s smoother when everyone manages their own sheet. Like the oxygen mask rule: secure your own first before helping another PC.

## Keep In-Character and Out-of-Character Clear.
Speak as your character when you’re in the scene, and flag when you’re speaking as yourself (“out of character” works fine).
Also, if a choice feels right for your character — even if it’s not the smartest meta move — go for it. That’s where great moments come from.

## Phones and Devices
Devices are totally fine if you’re using them for the game (like dice apps or D&D Beyond). Please keep general browsing, texting, or other distractions to breaks so we can stay focused on the table. If something urgent comes up, step away anytime — no problem. 

## Food and Drinks
Snacks are welcome! We’ll coordinate who’s bringing what so no one goes hungry. Please be mindful of dietary restrictions (like allergies) and keep messy food away from character sheets, minis, or maps. Alcohol is okay as long as it doesn’t interfere with play — if it starts to affect the group, we’ll dial it back.

## Crosstalk
Let’s make sure everyone gets time to shine. Try not to interrupt or talk over other players during roleplay or combat. If you feel like you haven’t had as much spotlight, let me know outside the session — I’ll make sure you get more opportunities in future scenes.

## Backseat Adventuring
Everyone gets to decide how their own character acts. Try not to pressure or correct someone else’s choices, even if you’d play differently. Suggestions are fine if asked for, but otherwise let each character live and grow in their own way.

>[!dmnote] DM Authority
You’re encouraged to ask questions, make suggestions, or challenge a ruling politely. At the end of the day, the DM makes a call to keep the game moving. My promise in return is that rulings will always be fair and consistent.

## Metagaming
You don’t need to stress about “doing it wrong.” If you make decisions as your character — even if they’re messy, funny, or risky — it’s very welcome if it makes the story more fun for everyone at the table. Metagaming (using player knowledge your character doesn’t have) is fine if you slip into it, but leaning into roleplay makes the game shine.





# Above the Table
`Before and after the dice hit the table, we take a few moments to check in as people, not just characters. These small pauses — a recap, a quick debrief, a boundary check — help keep the story strong and the group healthy.`

## Debriefs and Check-ins
We’ll start each session with a quick recap and wrap up with a short debrief.

The **recap** gets everyone back on the same page — what happened last time, what’s changed, and what you might want to do next.

The **debrief** at the end is a chance to talk out of character. Share what you liked, what didn’t land, or anything that felt off. It’s also a good time to check in on tone and comfort levels so we can keep the game fun and balanced for everyone.

These little moments help us stay grounded in the story and make sure everyone’s having a good time.

> [!question] How committed are we in seeing this campaign thru?
> - Do we do in-person sessions, and what would be the logistics of that?
> - How often do we meet, and for how many hours per session?
> - What happens if someone can’t make it? (Reschedule, skip, run a side scene, etc.)
> - What are our expectations for showing up on time and communicating absences?
> > [!dmnote] As a DM,
> > I am more inclined to reward good player behavior than punish. Be a consistent good player and maybe you'll find an enchanted item on our next quest 😁

## The DM Knows Everything.
Not just a power trip, I promise — I actually need to know everything.
Secrets are great, and I encourage them! Just share them privately first so I can help weave them in. If you want to reveal or change something about your past, check in with me before dropping it mid-scene.

## Off-Limit Topics
Part of Session 0 will be making sure everyone feels safe with the story we tell together. We’ll go around and set boundaries about what topics we don’t want to see in the game (examples could include certain kinds of violence, relationships, or other sensitive material). If something feels uncomfortable to you, please let me know away from the table. 

> [!important]
> If at any point something in the game makes you uncomfortable, you don’t need to explain or justify — you can simply signal it (for example, by using an “X Card” or another agreed-upon method). When that happens, we’ll edit, pause, or redirect the story without making it awkward. Everyone’s comfort matters more than the narrative
