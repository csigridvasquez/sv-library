# Lay of the Land

## A Living World
The world is alive, not empty. It has storms, beasts, ruins, and factions with their own goals. It doesn’t bend to your will, but it will react to your presence. This campaign isn’t just about what happens — it’s about how your characters exist within the story.  Your group’s choices, tone, and priorities will shape that balance. 

You might be:
	**The Heroes.** The story revolves around you. Your names will be remembered, and your choices will shape the fate of nations.
	**The Unseen Hands.** You move behind the curtain — spies, manipulators, quiet fixers. The world changes because of you, but few will ever know it.
	**The Witnesses.** You aren’t here to save the world, but to _see_ it — to survive it, understand it, or simply live within it. The world moves on, and you discover what it means to exist inside it.

There’s no “better” role here. Each one is valid, and the story will adapt to the level of scale and impact your party naturally creates.





# Systems of Survival

## Roleplaying
This is a campaign where characters matter as much as combat. What your character fears, what they dream of, and how they connect to others will drive the story forward. Expect chances to bond, bicker, and show off your quirks. Roleplay here isn’t about doing voices or acting “perfect” — it’s simply about letting your character feel real in the world.

## Story-Forward, Player-Lead
There’s no fixed path or “right” answer. You decide what matters most: exploring the lands, chasing mysteries, or trying to rebuild something new. The campaign follows your lead, so your decisions set the tone and direction of the story. Mechanics support the narrative, not the other way around.

## Homebrews
This campaign uses custom mechanics (Damage Explosion, Rolling with Emphasis, Critical Mastery, etc. See [[Homebrew Mechanics\|Homebrew Mechanics]]). These aren’t here to overcomplicate; they’re here to give flavor and reinforce the vibe. If something ever feels clunky or not fun, we’ll tweak it together so the game stays smooth.
