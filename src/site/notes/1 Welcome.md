# **Hello!**

## Welcome to my Digital Library :OcHeartFill24:

This doc is just a quick look at what campaign prep with me usually feels like. It’s mainly here so new joiners know what to expect before we start putting a campaign together.

Your actual game will come out of our [[6 Prep Sessions\|prep chats]], might apply most of the [[3 Homebrew Mechanics\|3 Homebrew Mechanics]], and follow the [[PC and Party\|Character Creation]] guidelines in this document.

As always, any questions, please reach out!
***Sigrid***

>If any of it feels too basic or too much, that simply means you’re already ahead of the curve.
