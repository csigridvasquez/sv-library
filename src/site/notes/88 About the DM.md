# **Hello again! I'm Sigrid :)**

*Shout out to my parents who gifted me a cool name for my birthday.*

The title "DM" is fairly new to me; I haven't really been in this hobby for long. I bought a Dropout subscription in June 2025 because I wanted to binge all of ***Um, Actually***, and discovered ***Dimension 20*** from there. Needless to say I just fell into the hole, daydreaming about what kinds of stories and character builds I'd play. I wrote as part of my intro in a D&D discord community:

> I'm incredibly interested in the writing and the gamemaking parts - so much so na only a few days in consuming my first D&D media (dimension20 baby!), I already started writing like a thing to get my friends and brother to play. I'm thinking the easiest genre to get them to play is def a zombie game, so i started just poring over that - lore, mechanics and all - before finding out about whole other established systems ![🤣](https://discord.com/assets/e5bddb2a9171637d.svg) Then I learned the word homebrew ![😁](https://discord.com/assets/7fff0841b901c035.svg) addtl: as a craft girlie of course I am DIY-ing my DM box and planning to use perlers for minis for one of my games ![😄](https://discord.com/assets/58a76b2430663605.svg) 

As you can imagine, it's really the role of the dungeon master that drew me in as I followed up every Dimension 20 binge with ***Adventuring Academy***, and just listening to people who love this thing made me fall in love with it too. Fortunately, I'm pretty sure I have the right type A-ness for it (hence this website, when I could just send you all an unformatted google doc).

So that's me!

I have 3 kids - Ninja, Mage and Jinx. 🐈

I’m a headhunter by day, so talking to strangers on camera (lol) is second nature — and a big part of my job. I've been in enough Zoom meetings to definitively say it's easier to connect with other people when you actually sense that there is another person at the end of this line, and not just me talking to a wall.

Friday and Saturday nights I swap out the ***M*** in *DM*, and I'm usually out playing gigs. More recently though I'm choosing to stay home and it's been great and refreshing honestly; and filling that time with DM prep stuff instead has been enjoyable.

That said, I look forward to the awesome story we'll write together!
