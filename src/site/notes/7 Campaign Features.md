# Campaign Features
---
This is where we start thinking about the kind of adventure you want to dive into. I’ve got a table of genres and campaign elements we can mix and match, and a few ideas already in mind.

Before we lock anything in, I’d love to hear what sparks your interest.

>[!warning|no-icon] Are there particular themes, tones, or story hooks that sound exciting to you? Your input helps shape the game from the very start.

# Style of Play
---

>[!note|no-icon]- Heroes  
You are visible figures the world turns to when things go wrong. People ask for help, expect courage, and notice your actions. Doing the right thing matters, even when it costs something.

>[!note|no-icon]- Unseen Hands
You work behind the scenes to shape events without drawing attention. Careful planning, timing, and subtle actions matter more than public recognition.

>[!note|no-icon]- Mercenaries
You take jobs, make deals, and decide what’s worth your time. Pay, favors, and reputation shape your choices more than grand ideals.

>[!note|no-icon]- Survivors
You focus on staying alive in a dangerous world. Preparation, resource management, and knowing when to retreat are as important as courage.

>[!note|no-icon]- Court
You move through circles of influence, favors, and social expectations. Conversations and relationships often matter as much as swords or spells.
