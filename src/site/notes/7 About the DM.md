# **Hello again! I'm Sigrid :)**


![DSC_3698blue.jpg|00|278x336](/img/user/media/DSC_3698blue.jpg)

Shout out to my parents who gifted me a cool name for my birthday.

The title "DM" is fairly new to me, I haven't really been in this hobby for long. I bought a Dropout subscription in June 2025 because I wanted to binge all of ***Um, Actually***, and discovered ***Dimension 20*** from there. Needless to say I hyperfixated, daydreaming about what kinds of stories and character builds I'd play; I have at least 4 fleshed out characters in dndbeyond at any given time, ready to go.

However, it's really the role of the dungeon master that drew me in as I followed up every Dimension 20 binge with ***Adventuring Academy***, and just listening to people who love this thing made me fall in love with it too. In any case, I'm pretty sure I have the right type A-nessfor it (hence this website, when I could just send you all an unformatted google doc).

So that's me!
I am a headhunter by day - so talking to strangers on camera is not only normal to me but is also really important. I've been in enough Zoom meetings to definitively say it's easier to connect with other people when you actually sense that there is another person at the end of this line, and not just me talking to a wall.

Friday and Saturday nights I swap out the ***M*** in *DM*, and I'm usually out playing gigs and therefore generally avoid scheduling anything. But of course feel free to send a message and I will reply as soon as I can :)

Here's to an awesome time storytelling with you!
